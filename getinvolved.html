                                <figcaption>Oprah Winfrey has championed access to quality education both in the United States and across the globe for more than a decade. <br />
                                    In 2007, she founded The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa â€” a school that offers girls from underprivileged backgrounds access to the education and support they need to thrive. And she has funded Charter Schools and college scholarships in Chicago, and Philadelphia among other cities.

                                Born in Pakistan, where 3 million girls do not attend primary school, she became an activist at a young age. In 2012, she was shot by the Taliban for speaking out publicly about the importance of education for girls, and gained international attention.

                                One of the issues Ban has passionately advocated for is climate action to help combat poverty. Alongside Bill Gates and World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva, he launched the Global Commission on Adaptation, an international coalition to mitigate climate change and its impact on vulnerable communities.
