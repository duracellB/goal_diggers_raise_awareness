          <h2>Invisible Barriers</h2>
          <p> Barriers are things such as a rule, law, or policy that makes it difficult or impossible for something to happen or be achieved. Invisible ones are those with the attitudes and underlying traditional assumptions, norms and values that prevent a group's empowerment/full participation in society. When it comes to poverty, there are many visible as well as hidden barriers that prevent people from improving their economic status. </p>

              <p>Employment disparities start early - "An analysis of the 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation reveals that black, Hispanic or Latino (referred to as Latinx in this post), and Asian youth were employed at much lower rates than white youth. And black and Latinx youth who did work were paid less than their white peers."</p>

              <p>Poverty results from structual barriers: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>In all but two states, families with earnings at the federal poverty level earn too much to qualify for cash assistance through TANF. For every 100 families experiencing poverty in 2019, only 23 received TANF cash assistance. </li>
                <li>Some states require costly drug tests, even though few people test positive. </li>
                <li>Both SNAP and TANF require adults to demonstrate they are working or engaged in allowable work activities as a condition of participation. </li>
                <li>Research shows work requirements neither address the root causes of poverty nor help people find and maintain stable, well-paying jobs that keep them out of poverty. </li>
                <li>The red tape associated with work requirements can lead to people losing access to benefits even when they are employed or should be exempt.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Exculsionary Zoning</h4>
              <p>Exclusionary zoning is an oft-mentioned policy that keeps affordable housing out of neighborhoods through land use and building code requirements. It’s a legal practice that has been used for decades to keep lower-income people—disproportionately racial minorities—out of wealthy and middle-class neighborhoods across the country, and prevents these low-income families from having access to the education and employment opportunities typically found in wealthier neighborhoods.</p>
