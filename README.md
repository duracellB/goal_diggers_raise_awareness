# Brighter Tomorrow

[Deployed Site](https://duracellb.github.io/goal_diggers_raise_awareness/hidden_barriers.html)

Brighter Tomorrow is about spreading awareness and raising hope - we wanted to focus on systemic poverty, but the question “how to solve poverty” was not something we had the answer for. Instead, we wanted to give information on the current state of affairs today and the cyclical nature of poverty in America. Since its such a broad topic, its easy to feel nihilistic about it all, so we also wanted to give hope and resources for people to make a difference however way they can, to work towards a brighter tomorrow.

This projects intention was to practice using libraries to enhance normal HTML & CSS sites.
