                <h2>Invisible Barriers</h2>
                <p> Barriers are things such as a rule, law, or policy that makes it difficult or impossible for something to happen or be achieved. Invisible ones are these, with attitudes and the underlying traditional assumptions, norms and values that prevent a group's empowerment/full participation in society. </p>

                <h2>Social Barriers</h2>
                <p>Employment disparities start early - "An analysis of the 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation reveals that black, Hispanic or Latino (referred to as Latinx in this post), and Asian youth were employed at much lower rates than white youth. And black and Latinx youth who did work were paid less than their white peers."</p>

                <p>"Marginalization deepens hardship and reduces life chances, perpetuating a vicious cycle of economic and social exclusion."</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Women’s pay still lags behind their male counterparts.</li>
                    <li>Long-term unemployed are stigmatized as un-hirable and remain unemployed.</li>
                    <li>Pregnant workers are mistreated to spur resignation</li>
                    <li>Racism is pervasive with black men half as likely as their white peers to receive a return phone call for service industry jobs.</li>

                    <p>Poverty results from structual barriers: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In all but two states, families with earnings at the federal poverty level earn too much to qualify for cash assistance through TANF. For every 100 families experiencing poverty in 2019, only 23 received TANF cash assistance. </li>
                        <li>Some states require costly drug tests, even though few people test positive. </li>
                        <li>Both SNAP and TANF require adults to demonstrate they are working or engaged in allowable work activities as a condition of participation. </li>
                        <li>Research shows work requirements neither address the root causes of poverty nor help people find and maintain stable, well-paying jobs that keep them out of poverty. </li>
                        <li>The red tape associated with work requirements can lead to people losing access to benefits even when they are employed or should be exempt.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Exculsionary Zoning</h3>
                    <p>Exclusionary zoning is an oft-mentioned policy that keeps affordable housing out of neighborhoods through land use and building code requirements. It’s a legal practice that has been used for decades to keep lower-income people—disproportionately racial minorities—out of wealthy and middle-class neighborhoods across the country, and prevents these low-income families from having access to the education and employment opportunities typically found in wealthier neighborhoods.</p>
